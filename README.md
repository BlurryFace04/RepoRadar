RepoRadar is a beacon of technology, powered by Python and illuminated by several cutting-edge technologies:

* **GitHub REST API:** The lifeblood of RepoRadar, providing a direct link to the pulsating heart of GitHub's vast data. It allows us to fetch intricate details about user repositories and the vibrant open-source projects that populate GitHub. Please note that due to GitHub API's rate limitations, the application may take a little longer to fetch results.

* **ChromaDB:** Our secret weapon for providing personalized recommendations. ChromaDB helps us create a unique collection of repositories and applies machine learning magic to find repositories that resonate with your coding preferences. RepoRadar uses a content-based filtering algorithm in its recommendation system, ensuring that the recommendations are tailored to your specific interests.

* **Streamlit:** The face of RepoRadar. Streamlit helps us present a user-friendly web interface that's as easy to navigate as it is pleasing to the eye. It's the open-source app framework that brings our Machine Learning and Data Science to life.

RepoRadar also offers an optional feature to provide your OpenAI API key. This allows the application to use the embedding function provided by the text-embedding-ada-002 model. While this may slow down the application a bit more, it will generate better and more personalized recommendations.

RepoRadar is not just about discovery—it's about making a difference. It's about contributing to the open-source community, sharing your skills, and learning from the collective wisdom of developers worldwide.
